To compute the isobaric heat capacity $C_p$, the molar mass of copper $M = 63.546\frac{\text{g}}{\text{mol}}$, the sample's mass $m = \text{g}$, the energy $E$ that was added to the system and the temperature difference $\Delta T$ that was achieved by adding this amount of energy are required. \\
To get the energy, the voltage $U$, the current $I$ and the time interval $\Delta t$ over which energy was added to the system were measured. To get the temperature $T$ of the system, the thermometre's resistance $R$ was measured, since the temperature can then be measured via
\begin{aquation}
  T\lbr R \rbr = 0.00134 R^2 + 2.296 R - 243.02 \tp
\end{aquation}
The resistance steps have been chosen carefully to ensure that $\Delta T$ is always $10\text{K}$. To get the isobaric heat capacity, the measured and computed values have to be plugged into the equation 
\begin{aquation}
  C_p &= \frac{M}{m} \frac{E}{\Delta T}\tp
\end{aquation}
