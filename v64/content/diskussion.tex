The dependence of the polarisation angle of the contrast has shown a good agreement between the expected theory and the measured values with an angle-offset of $\delta=\SI{1.620\pm 0.010}{}$.
This shows that the experimental setup was well adjusted.
This is reflected in the maximum contrast that was measured to be $K= \SI{0.697\pm 4e-3}{}$, while the theoretical maximum is $K=1$. 
This results in a deviation of $\SI{30.32\pm0.4}{\percent}$.
Sources of errors are small misalignments that add up over the course of the path of the light. \newline
The refraction index of glass was determined to be $n=\num{1.0211\pm 9e-4}$, which is in good agreement with the literature value of $n_{\text{literature}}(\lambda=\SI{632.99}{\nano\meter})=\num{1.52}$ \cite{RefractiveIndex}.
It showed a deviation of $\SI{1.45\pm 0.6}{\percent}$.
Counting in the fact that the setup was not perfectly aligned, this deviation is satisfactory.
The refraction index of air was determined to be $n=1-\num{7 \pm 5 e-7}$, which is in good agreement with the literature value of $n_{\text{air}}=\num{1.00027653}$ \cite{RefractiveIndex} as it shows a deviation of $\SI{7e-5}{\percent}$.
In summary, the experiment was successful and the results are in good agreement with the literature values.
