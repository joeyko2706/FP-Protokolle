\subsection{The Sagnac Interferometer}
\label{sec:The_Sagnac_Interferometer}
A Sagnac interferometer is a device built out of multiple mirrors and a polarising beam splitter cube (PBSC). Its purpose is to split a laser beam entering the interferometer into two beams, which can then be redirected over different path. A sketch of the device can be seen in \autoref{fig:interferometer}.\\
To split the beam, it first goes through the PBSC at a $45$ degree angle to the beam. This reflects s-polarised light, while transmitting p-polarised light. The beams then get reflected thrice via multiple mirrors to reenter the PBSC. A portion of each of these beams is then transmitted/reflected into the output area, as shown in \autoref{fig:interferometer}.\\

If the interferometer is perfectly adjusted, the resulting beams will overlap at all stages of the interferometer. To manipulate each beam individually, it is necessary to separate their superposition. To do so the laser, or in this case the mirror between the laser and the second mirror, has to be moved in the direction that is shown by the arrow in the picture. This results in the two beams following different paths after entering the PBSC. During this stage, one of the beams can be sent through a medium, making it possible to measure the medium's refraction index.\\
An important quantity for interferometers is the contrast. The name is self-explanatory: Just like in the case of colours, where the contrast between two colours is highest if they are opposite to each other (for example black and white) and lowest if both colours are the same, the contrast in an interference picture is defined as 
\begin{aquation}
  K &= \frac{I_\text{max}-I_\text{min}}{I_\text{max} + I_\text{min}} \tc
  \label{eq:contrast}
\end{aquation}
with minimal and maximal intensities $I_\text{min}$ and $I_\text{max}$.\\
The closer the contrast is to $1$, the better it is. On the other hand, it is worse the lower it is. The ideal contrast therefore occurs for $I_\text{min}=0$, while the worst case is that there are no minima/maxima, meaning that $I_\text{min}=I_\text{max}$.\\
In this experiment, the contrast will be measured dependent on the phase angle of a polarisation filter that has been positioned in the beam's path. For this, the contrast takes the form 
\begin{aquation}
K &= A|\sin(2\varphi + \delta)| \tp
\end{aquation}

\subsection{Interference}
The HeNe laser used in this experiment emits linearly polarised light. For this reason, the derivation for the interference occuring in this experiment will be started with light that is linearly polarised in the $x$-direction, while the beam is moving in the $z$-direction. In this case, the electric field is 
\begin{aquation}
  \label{eq:beam_x}
  \vec{E}_x\left(\vec x , t\right) &= Re\left( E_0 \vec{e}_x \exp\left(ikz - i\omega t\right)\right) \tp
\end{aquation}
To get the more general case of linear polarisation in any direction, the emitter can be rotated, which is equivalent to the application of the rotation operator
\begin{aquation}
  \hat M (\delta) &\coloneqq 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos(\delta) & -\sin(\delta) \\
    \sin(\delta) & \cos(\delta)
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aquation}
for a rotation angle of $\delta$.\\
In the experiment, a polarisation filter will be placed between the laser beam and the PBSC. Using the condition that the polariser should neutralise the wave in the case of a polarisation angle perpendicular to the beam's polarisation angle $\delta$ ($\phi = \delta = \frac{\pi}{2}$) and preserve it if $\phi = \delta$, the filter's matrix representation can be derived to be 
\begin{aquation}
  \hat P (\phi) &\coloneqq 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos^2(\phi) & \sin(\phi)\cos(\phi) \\
    \sin(\phi)\cos(\phi) & \sin^2(\phi) \tp
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aquation}
Applying both these operators in order to wave in \autoref{eq:beam_x}, the beam that will enter the PBSC is
\begin{aquation}
  \label{eq:E_pbsc}
  &\vec{E}_\text{PBSC} &\coloneqq \hat P (\phi) \hat M (\delta) &= \left( \left(E_x\cos^2(\phi) + E_y\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi)\right) \vec{e}_x \right. \\
  &&& \hspace{1.5mm} + \left.\left(E_x\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi) + E_y\sin^2(\phi) \right) \vec{e}_y \right) \cos\left(kz - \omega t\right) \tp
\end{aquation}
The final step is the splitting of the beam, after which one of the partial beams goes through a phase-shift before reuniting them.\\
Inducing a phase shift $\varphi$ in a beam is achieved by application of the translation operator 
\begin{aquation}
  &\hat T(\varphi) \coloneqq \exp\left(\frac{\varphi}{\omega} \partial_t\right) \tp
\end{aquation}
But the PBSC does not only split the beam, but also splits its phases. In this experiment, the PBSC is positioned in a $\frac{\pi}{4}$ angle to the incoming beam. For simplicity, the incoming beam's linear polarisation will be taken to have $\delta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, because this way, the $x$- and $y$-components have the same amplitude of $\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}$. Due to the PBSC's tilt, the spllitting surface is aligned with the beam's $y$-component. This way, the $y$-component is transmitted, while the $x$-component undergoes reflection and phase-shift, which is why the full aperture from the PBSC to the interferometer's end also has to project the $x$- and $y$-components accordingly. For this, the parity operators 
\begin{align}
  \hat{P}_L &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 
  \end{pmatrix} \\
  \hat{P}_R &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
are very useful. Using these, the combined projection and translation operator representing the aperture from PBSC to the leaving point of the interferometer can be written as 
\begin{aquation}
  &\hat{T}_\text{Int}(\phi) \coloneqq \left(\hat T(0)\hat{P}_L + \hat T(\varphi)\hat{P}_R\right) \tp
\end{aquation}
At this point, the requirement for the monochromaticity of the light used in interference experiments becomes manifest: The translation operator directly depends on the frequency $\omega$ (and therefore on the wavelength $\lambda$). For this reason multichromatic light would get a different phase shift for each colour, which would smear the interference pattern the further it derives from monochromaticity.\\
Applying this translation operator on the electric field in \autoref{eq:E_pbsc} yields
\begin{align}
  \vec{E}_\text{Int} &= \hat{T}_\text{Int}(\varphi) \vec{E}_\text{PBSC} \\
                     &= \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \left(\cos^2(\phi) + \sin(\phi)\cos(\phi)\right) \vec{e}_x \cos\left(kz - \omega t + \varphi\right)\right. \\
                     & \left.\hspace{9.2mm}+\left(\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi) + \sin^2(\phi) \right) \vec{e}_y \cos\left(kz - \omega t\right)\right] \tp
\end{align}
Now, the intensity needs to be computed.\\
The formula for this is
\begin{aquation}
  &I &\propto \langle \hspace{1mm} |\vec{E}|^2\rangle_t \tc
\end{aquation}
with them time average operator $\langle\text{...}\rangle_t$ performing a time-integral over one period (here: $T = 2\pi$).\\
This operator only acts on the cosines. For the squared cosines, this gives $\oh$, while for the interference term $2\cos\left(kz - \omega t\right) \cos\left(kz - \omega t + \varphi\right)$, the time averaging gives $\cos(\varphi)$.




Together, this results in the intensity
\begin{aquation}
  &I &\propto E_x^2 \left(\cos^2(\phi) + \sin(\phi)\cos(\phi)\right)^2 + E_y^2 \left(\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi) + \sin^2(\phi)\right)^2 \text{...}
\end{aquation}

To get interference to work, it is necessary that the light used is coherent. Coherence is essentially a property of light that makes it possible to have two phase-correlated beams, even after splitting the beam. Coherenct light is monochromatic.\\
The polarisation of light moving in the $z$ direction is a relative phase-shift between its electrical field's $y$- and $x$-component, which means that the wave generally takes the form 
\begin{aquation}
  \vec{E} &\coloneqq \text{Re}\left(\left[E_x \vec{e}_x + E_y \vec{e}_y e^{i \delta}\right] e^{i k z - i \omega t}\right) \\
  &= E_x \vec{e}_x \cos(k x - \omega t) + E_y \vec{e}_y \cos(k y - \omega t + \delta) \tp
\end{aquation}
The general case is elliptic polarisation, which is for arbitrary phase $\delta$. The two special cases of elliptic polarisation are linear polarisation ($\delta = 0,\pi$) and circular polarisation ($\delta = \frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}$). In this experiment, linearly polarised light will be used, which is generated by sending the initial laser beam through a linear polariser.\\
For two waves of light to interfere with each other, they must not have a phase-shift of exactly $\frac{\pi}{2}$. For example, s- and p-polarised beams can not interfere with each other for this reason. The further to parallel polarisation they get, the stronger the interference, because at any time, only the parallel components of the beams can interfere with each other.\\
To illustrate this, the effects of sending a beam of light at a surface that lies in the $x-z$-plane can be considered. Per Fresnel's law, the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted light are handled separately for the s- and p-polarisation (s meaning perpendicular (here: along the $y$-axis) to the surface and p meaning parallel (here: in the $x-z$-plane)). The polarising beam splitter cube (PBSC) used in this experiment acts like a semi-transparent mirror that is at a $\frac{\pi}{4}$ angle to the beam, but also gives the reflected beam the full s-polarisation with no p-polarisation, while the transmitted beam gets it the other way around.\\
In this experiment, the incoming beam is polarised vertically, meaning that its only electric field component is in the $y$-direction. For an untilted PBSC (meaning that the splitting surface is in the $x-y$-plane), the beam's polarisation is already purely parallel to the plane. Since the cube transmits p-polarisation, the beam is transmitted without any reflection. Tilting the cube by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ around the $x$-axis changes the polarisation components relative to the surface. In fact, in this case, one half of the beam is s-polarised, while the other half is p-polarised.
