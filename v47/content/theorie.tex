\subsection{The Refractory Index}
For any matter, its refractory index $n$ is defined via 
\begin{aquation}
    k &= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0} n \tp
\end{aquation}
The wavevector $k$ inside any medium can therefore be derived from the wavelength in the vacuum $\lambda_0$ and the refcactory index.\\
Sending two corehentt laser beams through two different mediums therefore results in them having different wavevectors, which is equivalent to them having different wavelengths/frequencies.\\
Having them move a distance of $L$ therefore leads to a relative phase difference. The phase of one beam is always $\varphi_i = k_i L$. In numbers, the phase difference then is
\begin{aquation}
    \Delta \varphi &= \frac{2\pi L}{\lambda_0} (n_2 - n_1) \tp
\end{aquation}
